# Ez Password Generator

Super simple password generator.

## Getting Started

There are only two inputs. The first one being the length of the password you want to generate,
and the second being how many passwords you want to generate.

The passwords are saved in new text file names "password.txt". When you hit "generate" again, it
**will** re-write the file so make sure you have the old passwords saved somewhere. (if you want to use those, of course.)


### Installing

No installation required. Just hit download on the release. File name is "main.exe".
